# ProyectoInvasion    
This project is a vocational course project, so **this game will not be released or purchased** on any kind (there are copyright issues concerning sprites of Link and Zelda monsters, music and so on and I am aware of it).    
This project is my first game on Android (and my first coded game in general) and it is a tribute to Zelda games.   
You have to shoot arrows to monsters and then to increase your score.    
There is a ranking table.
